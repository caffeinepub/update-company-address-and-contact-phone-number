  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by updating backend `companyInfo` returned from `getCompanyInfo()` with the new address and phone. REQ-2 appears implemented by updating the Contact UI to use the new address/phone as fallback values when `companyInfo` is unavailable. However, the diff also includes changes/additions not requested, including modifying an explicitly immutable frontend hook and adding project state/migration scaffolding.",
